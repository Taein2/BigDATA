Painting restorers are highly trained in their techniques, but they would have to 
 be the original painter to know exactly what to do with the work at hand. Technical 
 aspects of the work, such as dirt removal, are quite straightforward. What is important 
 is to bring a painting back to an artist's original intent. In order to do so, they
have to decide if they should add something to the painting or leave it as it is. They 
admit it is extremely difficult to determine what should and should not be retouched. 
"Our goal is to respect the artist's intent, but at the same time to make it a visually 
coherent work of art," says Michael Duffy of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
